# go-websocket-broadcast
 This Go project creates a simple broadcast server using websockets. The CLI accepts broadcast-server start (to start the server) and broadcast-server connect (to connect a client). The server broadcasts messages from any client to all connected clients. Error handling and graceful shutdown are included.
